                        Goal of this project
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        The aim of the project was a feasibility study to answer the question whether questions can be
                        generated automatically from any german text. The original project assignment included both cloze
                        text, knowledge questions and multiple choice tasks. For time reasons, the focus was placed on
                        knowledge questions in the form of W questions (Who/Where/What/When... ?).
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                        Starting position
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        Quizzes will be generated automatically for the game and learning platform "Unser Dorf". The
                        teachers who fill the platform with data can use the quiz generator to generate a series of quiz
                        questions for the students. These questions can then be used for learning control. This project
                        originally started as a single requirement of the IP417bbOLD_UnserDorf project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project IP518bb_QuizGenerator should find out whether quiz questions can be generated
                        automatically from any free text. For this purpose a feasibility study is to be accomplished.
                    </p>

                        Results
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        The question has been answered: Yes, questions can be generated automatically from any text.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        An application in the form of an iPython notebook was implemented, which generates a series of
                        questions from any text. These are rudimentarily evaluated and corrected by the application.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In addition, a web crawler was developed which automatically saves and pre-cleans all texts of a website as CSV. This web crawler was used to prepare the texts of the website www.laeufelfingen.com for the QuizGenerator.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The quality of the generated questions was tested four times with a series of test persons in a modified version of the Turing test: For every 20 questions, the respondents were asked to indicate whether they thought that the question was more likely to be generated by a computer or written by hand. Quality assurance showed that the quality of the questions is good, but still capable of improvement.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The resulting application has a modular structure and can be expanded in a follow-up project. In addition, the project with the WebCrawler was published under the MIT license on GitHub.
                    </p>
